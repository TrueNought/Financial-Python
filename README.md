# Financial Python

## Work-In-Progress!
Using what I have learned about coding and Python, I am currently attempting to graph and analyze stock data. 
The end goal of this project is to develop a fully-functional algorithmic trading program.

## Stock Grapher
This graphing program takes in a company and a specified time interval as inputs, and will output a graph of the 
company's stock prices throughout that time interval, complete with line graphs of the 50-day and 200-day moving 
averages as well as the trading volume. 


The stock data is obtained through Yahoo's API with the help of the pandas module, and is stored in a csv file that
will be created in the same local folder when the program runs.
